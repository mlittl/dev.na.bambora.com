# IP Addresses

In order to ensure a secure integration to Bambora, you must be able to communicate with one of our fully qualified domains. If your integration uses IP Safelisting, you will need to add Bambora's IP addresses to your safelist.


## Domains

Bambora uses the following fully qualified domain names:

```
api.na.bambora.com
web.na.bambora.com
```

## IP Addresses

The full list of IP addresses in CIDR notation that `api.na.bambora.com` and `web.na.bambora.com` can resolve to:

```
<%= partial 'includes/na/ip_addresses/ips.txt' %>
```
⚠️ Always use the DNS names `api.na.bambora.com` or `web.na.bambora.com` to interact with our APIs. Never communicate with an IP Address directly. Bambora IP addresses are subject to change. To be notified of changes, follow our <%= link_to 'release notes', 'https://help.na.bambora.com/hc/en-us/sections/360007996574-Release-Notes' %>.


## Response Notifications

If your integration is configured to receive [Response Notifications](/docs/guides/recurring_payment/#notifications), you should ensure these events originate from one of our listed IP Addresses above.


## Downloading

For convenience, we have provided our IP Address list as a `.txt` file for easy import into `iptables` and similar tools:

  - <%= link_to 'ip_addresses.txt', '/ip_addresses.txt' %>
